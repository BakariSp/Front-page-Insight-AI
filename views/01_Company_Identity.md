# Company Identity & Team Context

## 1. Core Identity & Strategic Vision

- **Company Name:** Insight AI Limited (观界智能有限公司)

- **Positioning:** **Adaptive AI Infrastructure for K12 Education**
    (不仅仅是工具，而是基于私有数据飞轮的自进化教育智能体平台)

- **The Real Problem (What we solve):**
    1.  **The "Generic AI" Gap:** General LLMs (like GPT-4) lack specific pedagogical context and curriculum alignment. They give answers but don't understand *how* to teach or grade according to specific school standards.
    2.  **Data Waste:** In traditional schools, valuable data (teacher's corrections, grading logic, student thought processes) is discarded. There is no mechanism to "capture" expert teacher wisdom to train AI.
    3.  **Fragmented Experience:** Schools lack a unified Agent platform (MCP) to connect scattered tools into a coherent "Digital Teacher" experience.

- **Our Solution (The "Insight Engine"):**
    1.  **End-to-End Workflow (The Body):** A complete SaaS platform covering digitization, auto-grading, and tutoring. We don't just solve one point; we own the data flow from Homework Upload to Knowledge Graph Analysis.
    2.  **Teacher-in-the-Loop Flywheel (The Brain):** We use a proprietary "Correction-as-Training" mechanism. When teachers modify our AI's grading, that data creates a feedback loop (RLHF) to fine-tune our vertical models. The more teachers use it, the smarter and more "school-specific" our AI becomes.
    3.  **Agentic SDK & MCP (The Limbs):** Building on this optimized model, we provide an Agent SDK (Context Engineering) that allows schools/parents to deploy "Digital Teachers." These Agents understand the specific student's context and the school's curriculum, bridging B2B (School) and B2C (Student Tutoring).

- **Vision:** To build the **Operating System for AI Education**, where every interaction improves the intelligence of the network, ultimately delivering hyper-personalized, Socratic tutoring to every student.

- **Business Model:** **B2B2C Data Flywheel:** * **Entry:** SaaS for Schools (High retention, capturing high-quality proprietary data/context).
    * **Monetization:** AI Tutoring Agents for Parents/Students (Powered by the exclusive model trained on school data).

## 2. Prior Validation: Zero-AI
> Before Insight AI, the founding team built **Zero-AI** — an AI-powered personalized learning path generator.
> - **1,000+ test users** during demo phase.
> - **Key Learning:** Pure AI tutoring has limits. Real educational impact requires **teacher collaboration and institutional trust**.
> - This insight directly shaped our **B2B-first, Teacher-in-the-Loop** strategy.
