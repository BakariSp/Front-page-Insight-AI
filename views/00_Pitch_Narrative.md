# Investor Pitch Narrative

## Elevator Pitch (30 Seconds)

> "We are **Insight AI** — building the **Operating System for AI Education**.
>
> Founded by a PhD team from Tsinghua, UC Berkeley, and CityU, we're not just doing homework grading — we're building **Adaptive AI Infrastructure for K12**.
>
> Our secret weapon? **Teacher-in-the-Loop RLHF.** Every time a teacher corrects our AI's grading, that data trains our model. The more schools use us, the smarter we become — a self-evolving flywheel that generic LLMs can't replicate.
>
> We've bootstrapped a working prototype with 300k HKD, now in pilot discussions with Hong Kong schools. Our B2B2C model starts with schools (trust + data) and expands to parents (revenue). We're seeking incubation and pre-seed funding to become the Databricks of K12 education."

## The Problem

### 1. The "Generic AI" Gap
- ChatGPT, Claude, and other general-purpose LLMs **lack pedagogical context and curriculum alignment**.
- They give answers but don't understand *how to teach* or *grade according to specific school standards*.
- Result: Students cheat; teachers distrust AI.

### 2. Data Waste (The Hidden Tragedy)
- Every day, teachers make corrections, write feedback, and apply grading logic.
- This **expert wisdom is discarded** — no mechanism to capture it.
- Schools sit on goldmines of pedagogical data but have no way to leverage it.

### 3. Fragmented Experience
- Schools use 10+ disconnected tools: homework apps, grading software, tutoring platforms...
- No unified **Agent platform (MCP)** to connect them into a coherent "Digital Teacher" experience.
- Teachers and students suffer from tool fatigue.

## Our Solution: The Insight Engine

### The Core Insight
We don't just build tools — we build a **self-evolving educational intelligence platform** powered by a proprietary data flywheel.

### The Three-Layer Architecture

| Layer | Name | What It Does |
|-------|------|--------------|
| **The Body** | End-to-End Workflow | Complete SaaS platform: Homework Upload → Digitization → Auto-Grading → Knowledge Graph Analysis. We own the entire data flow. |
| **The Brain** | Teacher-in-the-Loop Flywheel | **"Correction-as-Training" RLHF.** When teachers modify our AI's grading, that data fine-tunes our vertical model. More teachers = smarter, more school-specific AI. |
| **The Limbs** | Agentic SDK & MCP | Agent SDK (Context Engineering) enabling schools/parents to deploy "Digital Teachers" that understand each student's context and the school's curriculum. |

### The Technical Edge
- **Pedagogical Prompt Engineering:** Built on CEO's PhD research at CityU (HCI & EdTech).
- **RLHF from Real Teachers:** Not synthetic data — real teacher corrections power our model evolution.
- **Domain-Specific Fine-Tuning:** Powered by Tsinghua Zhipu AI (GLM-4.6), optimized for educational dialogue.
- **Scaffolding Pedagogy:** AI guides students to think with hints and breakdowns, not direct answers.

## Business Model: B2B2C Data Flywheel

### Entry Point: B2B SaaS for Schools
| Benefit | Why It Matters |
|---------|----------------|
| **Trust** | Schools are gatekeepers — once we're in, parents and students follow. |
| **High-Quality Data** | Teacher corrections, grading logic, student thought processes — proprietary training data no competitor can buy. |
| **High Retention** | Switching costs are enormous once our AI learns a school's curriculum and standards. |

- **Current Status:** Working prototype (bootstrapped 300k HKD); 2 HK schools in pilot discussions; GBA inbound interest.

### Monetization: AI Tutoring Agents for Parents/Students
- School SaaS has a revenue ceiling. The real money is in B2C.
- Our AI Tutoring Agents are **powered by the exclusive model trained on school data**.
- Parents pay for:
  - **Hyper-personalized learning** (understands their child's specific curriculum)
  - **24/7 Socratic AI tutor access**
  - **Exam prep & advanced diagnostics**

### The Self-Reinforcing Flywheel
```
Schools (Data) → Teacher Corrections (RLHF) → Smarter AI → Better Student Outcomes → More Schools → More Data → Unassailable Moat
```

---

## Why Us? (The Moat)

### 1. Proprietary Data Flywheel (The Killer Advantage)
- Our **"Correction-as-Training"** mechanism captures expert teacher wisdom that's normally discarded.
- Every school that uses us makes our AI smarter — **compounding network effect**.
- OpenAI has internet data. We have **real teacher corrections** — fundamentally different and irreplaceable.

### 2. Research-Backed Pedagogy
- CEO's PhD at CityU focuses on HCI + EdTech + Scaffolding.
- Collaborated with UCLA Trustworthy AI Lab.
- This is not a "ChatGPT wrapper" — it's domain-specific AI built on learning science.

### 3. End-to-End Control
- We own the full stack: digitization → grading → tutoring → analytics.
- **No data leakage** — competitors can't intercept our flywheel.
- Unified Agent platform (MCP) solves the fragmentation problem.

### 4. Strategic Partnerships
- **Tsinghua Zhipu AI (清华智谱):** Joint R&D on education-specific LLM (GLM-4.6 based).
- **Academic Partners:** HKU, CityU for long-term research collaboration.

### 5. Team Pedigree
- **Tsinghua + UC Berkeley + CityU PhD** founding team.
- CTO & Head of Product are **full-time**; CEO in founder-mode (PhD + full commitment).
- **Prior validation:** Built Zero-AI (AI learning path generator) with **1,000+ test users**.
- Advisors from **Baidu Wenxin (ERNIE)** team and Zhipu AI.

## The Ask

**Stage:** Pre-Seed / Incubation  
**Bootstrapped:** 300k HKD founder capital invested

We are seeking **incubation programs and pre-seed funding** to:
1. **Complete the Product:** Finish data analytics features (progress tracking, weak-point analysis).
2. **Close First Pilots:** Convert 2 HK schools in discussion → paying customers; expand to 10-20 schools.
3. **Ignite the Flywheel:** Begin collecting teacher correction data for RLHF model fine-tuning.
4. **Prepare for Scale:** Build foundation for GBA expansion and B2C launch in 2026.
