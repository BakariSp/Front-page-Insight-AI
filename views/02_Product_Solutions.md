# Product Solutions & Value Proposition

## 1. The Insight Engine
**Positioning:** Adaptive AI Infrastructure for K12 Education  
(不只是工具，而是基于私有数据飞轮的自进化教育智能体平台)

## 2. Three-Layer Architecture

### Layer 1: End-to-End Workflow (The Body)
Complete SaaS platform owning the full data flow from homework to insights.

| Module | Pain Point | Solution |
|--------|------------|----------|
| **Smart OCR** | Teachers hate manual data entry | Photo → AI Recognition → One-click Digitization |
| **AI Grading** | Grading takes 40% of teacher's time | AI pre-grades with Rubrics → Teacher audits/modifies |
| **Data Insights** | No visibility into learning gaps | Auto-generated "Weak Point Analysis" & Class Reports |

### Layer 2: Teacher-in-the-Loop Flywheel (The Brain) ⭐
**The core differentiator: "Correction-as-Training"**

> When teachers modify AI's grading → That data feeds back (RLHF) → Fine-tunes our vertical model  
> **Result:** The more teachers use it, the smarter and more "school-specific" our AI becomes.

This creates a **proprietary data moat** that generic LLMs cannot replicate.

### Layer 3: Agentic SDK & MCP (The Limbs)
Building on the optimized model, we deploy **"Digital Teachers"** as AI Agents.

| Agent | For | Capability |
|-------|-----|------------|
| **AI Tutor** | Students | Socratic Guidance, Step-by-step Hints, Error Analysis |
| **Teaching Assistant** | Teachers | Lesson Planning, Personalized Homework Generation |
| **Parent Portal** | Parents | Progress Reports, Learning Recommendations |

## 3. Technical Moat

| Advantage | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Vertical LLM** | Fine-tuned on HK/DSE curriculum, past papers, local rubrics. Not a GPT wrapper. |
| **Data Flywheel** | Every teacher interaction improves model accuracy. Self-reinforcing competitive advantage. |
| **MCP Architecture** | Unified Agent platform connecting fragmented tools into coherent "Digital Teacher" experience. |
| **Compliance** | HK PDPO + China Data Security Laws. Cloud-native for 1000+ schools. |
