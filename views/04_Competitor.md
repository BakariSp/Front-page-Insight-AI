# Competitive Landscape

## 1. Market Gap

**No integrated AI platform exists for HK K12 that combines:**
- Homework assignment & management
- AI auto-grading (multi-subject)
- Learning analytics & tracking
- Teacher-in-the-Loop feedback mechanism

Most solutions are either **single-function** (language grading only) or **not localized** for HK curriculum (DSE/TSA).

## 2. Competitive Matrix

| Competitor | Category | Strengths | Weaknesses | Our Advantage |
|------------|----------|-----------|------------|---------------|
| **LingoTask** | Language AI Grading | 98% HK speech recognition; DSE/TSA aligned; 60-sec essay grading | Language subjects only; No platform/LMS | We cover **all subjects** + full workflow |
| **Snapask** | 1-on-1 Tutoring | 24/7 real-time Q&A; Large tutor network | Human-dependent (expensive); No school integration | We're **AI-native** + school-first |
| **EduGears AI** | Global AI LMS | Full-stack: lesson planning, grading, analytics | Not HK-localized; Generic curriculum | We're **HK DSE-specific** + Teacher-in-the-Loop |
| **UnaGPT** | AI Grading (GPT-4) | Teacher review modes; Quick setup | Trial ended; No LMS; No analytics | We offer **end-to-end platform** |
| **DingTalk Edu** | All-in-One Platform | Class mgmt + video + learning integrated | China-focused; No deep AI grading | We're **HK-compliant** + vertical AI |
| **Pregrade** | Essay Grading | Batch upload; Rubric-based; Good analytics | Higher-ed focused; Not K12 | We're **K12-focused** + local curriculum |

## 4. Our Differentiation (Why We Win)

| Dimension | Competitors | Insight AI |
|-----------|-------------|------------|
| **Curriculum** | Generic or single-language | HK DSE/TSA specific, all subjects |
| **AI Model** | GPT wrapper or rule-based | Vertical LLM + Teacher-in-the-Loop RLHF |
| **Data Moat** | No proprietary training data | Every teacher correction improves model |
| **Platform** | Point solutions | End-to-end: Upload → Grade → Tutor → Analytics |
| **Compliance** | Varies | HK PDPO + China Data Security ready |

## 5. Key Insight

> **LingoTask** proves HK schools will pay for AI grading (QEF-funded).  
> **Snapask** proves parents will pay for tutoring.  
> **No one** has combined both into a **school-first, AI-native, self-improving platform**.  
> 
> That's our opportunity.

## 6. Barriers to Entry

| Barrier | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Data Flywheel** | Teacher corrections create proprietary RLHF data that compounds over time |
| **Curriculum Depth** | HK DSE/TSA alignment requires local expertise and relationships |
| **School Trust** | Schools are conservative; first-mover with institutional relationships wins |
| **Switching Cost** | Once AI learns a school's standards, migration is painful |
