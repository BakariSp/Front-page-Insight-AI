## 2.2 Summary (Company's Long-term Goals, Mission and Positioning)

### 2.2.1 English (Max 300 words)

**Mission:** To reshape the logic of education through AI — freeing teachers from repetitive work so they can truly teach, and enabling every student to access quality, personalized education at a fraction of the cost.

**What We Do:** We provide schools with an integrated platform where teachers can efficiently grade assignments with AI assistance, deliver personalized feedback to every student, and gain data-driven insights into class performance. For students, we turn every homework submission into a personalized learning moment — AI that explains mistakes, suggests next steps, and adapts to individual learning patterns.

**The Data Flywheel:** Every time a teacher corrects or refines our AI's grading, that correction flows back to improve the model. The more teachers use Insight AI, the smarter it becomes — learning each school's rubrics, each teacher's standards, each student's patterns. This creates a self-reinforcing cycle: better AI → more teacher adoption → more corrections → even better AI. Unlike generic LLMs trained on internet data, our models are trained on real pedagogical decisions from real classrooms.

**Vision:** Every teacher becomes a super-teacher who can truly reach every student. Every student receives timely, quality feedback that was previously only possible with private tutors. Education scales without losing its human touch.

**Long-term Goals:**
- Become the standard AI-education infrastructure across Greater China and Asia
- Accumulate the largest dataset of real teacher corrections — our core competitive moat
- Serve 10M+ students with AI that genuinely understands pedagogy
- Free teachers from repetitive grading to focus on mentorship and inspiration

**Positioning:** Insight AI is the "interaction foundation" between frontier AI and K12 classrooms. We are not replacing teachers with AI — we are amplifying teachers through AI, starting from the daily homework loop that touches every student.

**Why Us:**
- PhD founders from Tsinghua, UC Berkeley, CityU — deep expertise in AI + Education
- Strategic R&D partnership with Tsinghua Zhipu AI (GLM foundation model)
- First-mover in capturing proprietary teacher-correction data at scale

We seek Cyberport incubation to sign first paying schools, validate our Teacher-in-the-Loop approach, and prepare for Greater Bay Area expansion.

**使命：** 深耕教育，以 AI 重塑教与学的逻辑——解放教师，让他们从重复劳动中回归真正的教育；惠及学生，让每个孩子都能低成本获得优质、个性化的学习支持。

**我们做什么：** 为学校提供一体化平台：教师借助 AI 高效批改作业、为每位学生生成个性化反馈、实时掌握班级学情。学生端，每次作业提交都变成个性化学习时刻——AI 解析错误、推荐下一步、适配个人学习节奏。

**数据飞轮：** 教师每一次对 AI 批改的修正，都会回流优化模型。用得越多，AI 越聪明——逐渐学会每所学校的评分标准、每位老师的教学风格、每个学生的学习模式。这形成自我强化的正向循环：AI 更准 → 教师更愿用 → 更多修正数据 → AI 更强。通用大模型训练于互联网数据，而我们的模型训练于真实课堂的教学决策——这是无法复制的壁垒。

**愿景：** 让每位教师成为能真正触达每个学生的"超级教师"；让每位学生获得过去只有私教才能提供的及时、优质反馈。教育规模化，但不失人性温度。

**长远目标：**
- 成为大中华及亚洲 K12 教育的标准 AI 基础设施
- 积累最大规模的真实教师批改数据——核心竞争壁垒
- 服务 1000 万+ 学生，让他们拥有真正懂教学的 AI
- 将教师从重复性批改中解放，专注于启发与引导

**定位：** 观界智能是前沿 AI 与 K12 课堂之间的"交互基座"。我们不是用 AI 替代教师，而是通过 AI 放大教师——从每天都在发生的作业批改循环开始。

**为什么是我们：** 清华、伯克利、城大博士团队，AI + 教育双重背景；与清华智谱 AI（GLM 大模型）战略研发合作；教师批改数据的先发优势。

我们寻求数码港孵化支持，签约首批付费学校、验证"教师在环"模式、筹备大湾区扩张。
